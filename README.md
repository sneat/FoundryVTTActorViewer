# Available Actors Viewer

This tool is to help players (and DMs) view their actors regardless of which world is running on your [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) instance. It makes heavy use of the [VTT External Actor Viewer](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/externalactor/) module as the source of the character JSON.

## Usage

1. Install the [VTT External Actor Viewer](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/externalactor/) module on your FoundryVTT instance.
2. Enable the Extenal Actor Viewer module on any world you would like available to view.
3. Visit https://sneat.github.io/FoundryVTTActorViewer/ to use
